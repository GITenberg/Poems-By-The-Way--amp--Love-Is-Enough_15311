<h3 style="margin-left: 25%;">FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA</h3>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Shall we wake one morn of spring,</div>
    <div>Glad at heart of everything,</div>
    <div>Yet pensive with the thought of eve?</div>
    <div>Then the white house shall we leave.</div>
    <div>Pass the wind-flowers and the bays,</div>
    <div>Through the garth, and go our ways,</div>
    <div>Wandering down among the meads</div>
    <div>Till our very joyance needs</div>
    <div>Rest at last; till we shall come</div>
    <div>To that Sun-god's lonely home,</div>
    <div>Lonely on the hillside grey,</div>
    <div>Whence the sheep have gone away;</div>
    <div>Lonely till the feast-time is,</div>
    <div>When with prayer and praise of bliss,</div>
    <div>Thither comes the country side.</div>
    <div>There awhile shall we abide,</div>
    <div>Sitting low down in the porch</div>
    <div>By that image with the torch:</div>
    <div>Thy one white hand laid upon</div>
    <div>The black pillar that was won</div>
    <div>From the far-off Indian mine;</div>
    <div>And my hand nigh touching thine,</div>
<a name="page4" id="page4"></a>
    <div>But not touching; and thy gown</div>
    <div>Fair with spring-flowers cast adown</div>
    <div>From thy bosom and thy brow.</div>
    <div>There the south-west wind shall blow</div>
    <div>Through thine hair to reach my cheek,</div>
    <div>As thou sittest, nor mayst speak,</div>
    <div>Nor mayst move the hand I kiss</div>
    <div>For the very depth of bliss;</div>
    <div>Nay, nor turn thine eyes to me.</div>
    <div>Then desire of the great sea</div>
    <div>Nigh enow, but all unheard,</div>
    <div>In the hearts of us is stirred,</div>
    <div>And we rise, we twain at last,</div>
    <div>And the daffodils downcast,</div>
    <div>Feel thy feet and we are gone</div>
    <div>From the lonely Sun-Crowned one,</div>
    <div>Then the meads fade at our back,</div>
    <div>And the spring day 'gins to lack</div>
    <div>That fresh hope that once it had;</div>
    <div>But we twain grow yet more glad,</div>
    <div>And apart no more may go</div>
    <div>When the grassy slope and low</div>
    <div>Dieth in the shingly sand:</div>
    <div>Then we wander hand in hand</div>
    <div>By the edges of the sea,</div>
    <div>And I weary more for thee</div>
    <div>Than if far apart we were,</div>
    <div>With a space of desert drear</div>
    <div>'Twixt thy lips and mine, O love!</div>
    <div>Ah, my joy, my joy thereof!</div>

    <div>Stood Odd of Tongue his door beside.</div>
    <div><i>What healing in summer if winter be vain?</i></div>
    <div>Dim and dusk the day was grown,</div>
    <div>As he heard his folded wethers moan.</div>
    <div>Then through the garth a man drew near,</div>
    <div>With painted shield and gold-wrought spear.</div>
    <div>Good was his horse and grand his gear,</div>
    <div>And his girths were wet with Whitewater.</div>
    <div>"Hail, Master Odd, live blithe and long!</div>
    <div>How fare the folk at Deildar-Tongue?"</div>
    <div>"All hail, thou Hallbiorn the Strong!</div>
    <div>How fare the folk by the Brothers'-Tongue?"</div>
    <div>"Meat have we there, and drink and fire,</div>
    <div>Nor lack all things that we desire.</div>
    <div>But by the other Whitewater</div>
    <div>Of Hallgerd many a tale we hear."</div>
    <div>"Tales enow may my daughter make</div>
    <div>If too many words be said for her sake."</div>
<a name="page6" id="page6"></a>
    <div>"What saith thine heart to a word of mine,</div>
    <div>That I deem thy daughter fair and fine?</div>
    <div>Fair and fine for a bride is she,</div>
    <div>And I fain would have her home with me."</div>
    <div>"Full many a word that at noon goes forth</div>
    <div>Comes home at even little worth.</div>
    <div>Now winter treadeth on autumn-tide,</div>
    <div>So here till the spring shalt thou abide.</div>
    <div>Then if thy mind be changed no whit.</div>
    <div>And ye still will wed, see ye to it!</div>
    <div>And on the first of summer days,</div>
    <div>A wedded man, ye may go your ways.</div>
    <div>Yet look, howso the thing will fall,</div>
    <div>My hand shall meddle nought at all.</div>
    <div>Lo, now the night and rain draweth up.</div>
    <div>And within doors glimmer stoop and cup.</div>
    <div>And hark, a little sound I know,</div>
    <div>The laugh of Snæbiorn's fiddle-bow,</div>
    <div>My sister's son, and a craftsman good,</div>
    <div>When the red rain drives through the iron wood."</div>
    <div>Hallbiorn laughed, and followed in,</div>
    <div>And a merry feast there did begin.</div>
    <div>Hallgerd's hands undid his weed,</div>
    <div>Hallgerd's hands poured out the mead.</div>
    <div>Her fingers at his breast he felt,</div>
    <div>As her hair fell down about his belt.</div>
    <div>Her fingers with the cup he took,</div>
    <div>And o'er its rim at her did look.</div>
    <div>Cold cup, warm hand, and fingers slim.</div>
    <div>Before his eyes were waxen dim.</div>
<a name="page7" id="page7"></a>
    <div>And if the feast were foul or fair,</div>
    <div>He knew not, save that she was there.</div>
    <div>He knew not if men laughed or wept,</div>
    <div>While still 'twixt wall and daïs she stept.</div>
    <div>Whether she went or stood that eve,</div>
    <div>Not once his eyes her face did leave.</div>
    <div>But  Snæbiorn laughed and  Snæbiorn sang,</div>
    <div>And sweet his smitten fiddle rang.</div>
    <div>And Hallgerd stood beside him there,</div>
    <div><i>So many times over comes summer again</i></div>
    <div>Nor ever once he turned to her,</div>
    <div><i>What healing in summer if winter be vain?</i></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Master Odd on the morrow spake,</div>
    <div><i>So many times over comes summer again.</i></div>
    <div>"Hearken, O guest, if ye be awake,"</div>
    <div><i>What healing in summer if winter be vain?</i></div>
    <div>"Sure ye champions of the south</div>
    <div>Speak many things from a silent mouth.</div>
    <div>And thine, meseems, last night did pray</div>
    <div>That ye might well be wed to-day.</div>
    <div>The year's ingathering feast it is,</div>
    <div>A goodly day to give thee bliss.</div>
    <div>Come hither, daughter, fine and fair,</div>
    <div>Here is a wooer from Whitewater.</div>
    <div>Fast away hath he gotten fame,</div>
    <div>And his father's name is e'en my name.</div>
    <div>Will ye lay hand within his hand,</div>
    <div>That blossoming fair our house may stand?"</div>
<a name="page8" id="page8"></a>
    <div>She laid her hand within his hand;</div>
    <div>White she was as the lily wand.</div>
    <div>Low sang  Snæbiorn's brand in its sheath,</div>
    <div>And his lips were waxen grey as death.</div>
    <div>"Snæbiorn, sing us a song of worth.</div>
    <div>If your song must be silent from now henceforth.</div>
    <div>Clear and loud his voice outrang,</div>
    <div>And a song of worth at the wedding he sang.</div>
    <div>"Sharp sword," he sang, "and death is sure."</div>
    <div><i>So many times over comes summer again</i>,</div>
    <div>"But love doth over all endure."</div>

<div class="stanza">
    <div>Now winter cometh and weareth away,</div>
    <div><i>So many times over comes summer again</i>,</div>

    <div><i>What healing in summer if winter be vain?</i></div>
    <div>Full soft he lay his love beside;</div>
    <div>But dark are the days of winter-tide.</div>
    <div>Dark are the days, and the nights are long,</div>
    <div>And sweet and fair was  Snæbiorn's song.</div>
    <div>Many a time he talked with her,</div>
    <div>Till they deemed the summer-tide was there.</div>
    <div>And they forgat the wind-swept ways</div>
    <div>And angry fords of the flitting-days.</div>
    <div>While the north wind swept the hillside there</div>
    <div>They forgat the other Whitewater.</div>
    <div>While nights at Deildar-Tongue were long,</div>
    <div>They clean forgat the Brothers'-Tongue.</div>
<a name="page9" id="page9"></a>
    <div>But whatso falleth 'twixt Hell and Home,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>To Odd spake Hallbiorn on a day</div>
    <div><i>So many times over comes summer again,</i></div>
    <div>"Gone is the snow from everyway."</div>
    <div><i>What healing in summer if winter be vain?</i></div>
    <div>"Now green is grown Whitewater-side,</div>
    <div>And I to Whitewater will ride."</div>
    <div>Quoth Odd, "Well fare thou winter-guest,</div>
    <div>May thine own Whitewater be best</div>
    <div>Well is a man's purse better at home</div>
    <div>Than open where folk go and come."</div>
    <div>"Come ye carles of the south country,</div>
    <div>Now shall we go our kin to see!</div>
    <div>For the lambs are bleating in the south,</div>
    <div>And the salmon swims towards Olfus mouth,</div>
    <div>Girth and graithe and gather your gear!</div>
    <div>And ho for the other Whitewater!"</div>
    <div>Bright was the moon as bright might be,</div>
    <div>And  Snæbiorn rode to the north country.</div>
    <div>And Odd to Reykholt is gone forth,</div>
    <div>To see if his mares be ought of worth.</div>
    <div>But Hallbiorn into the bower is gone</div>
    <div>And there sat Hallgerd all alone.</div>
    <div>She was not dight to go nor ride,</div>
    <div>She had no joy of the summer-tide.</div>
<a name="page10" id="page10"></a>
    <div>Silent she sat and combed her hair,</div>
    <div>That fell all round about her there.</div>
    <div>The slant beam lay upon her head,</div>
    <div>And gilt her golden locks to red.</div>
    <div>He gazed at her with hungry eyes</div>
    <div>And fluttering did his heart arise.</div>
    <div>"Full hot," he said, "is the sun to-day,</div>
    <div>And the snow is gone from the mountain-way</div>
    <div>The king-cup grows above the grass,</div>
    <div>And through the wood do the thrushes pass."</div>
    <div>Of all his words she hearkened none,</div>
    <div>But combed her hair amidst the sun.</div>
    <div>"The laden beasts stand in the garth</div>
    <div>And their heads are turned to Helliskarth."</div>
    <div>The sun was falling on her knee,</div>
    <div>And she combed her gold hair silently.</div>
    <div>"To-morrow great will be the cheer</div>
    <div>At the Brothers'-Tongue by Whitewater."</div>
    <div>From her folded lap the sunbeam slid;</div>
    <div>She combed her hair, and the word she hid.</div>
    <div>"Come, love; is the way so long and drear</div>
    <div>From Whitewater to Whitewater?"</div>
    <div>The sunbeam lay upon the floor;</div>
    <div>She combed her hair and spake no more.</div>
    <div>He drew her by the lily hand:</div>
    <div>"I love thee better than all the land."</div>
    <div>He drew her by the shoulders sweet:</div>
    <div>"My threshold is but for thy feet."</div>
    <div>He drew her by the yellow hair:</div>
    <div>"O why wert thou so deadly fair?</div>
<a name="page11" id="page11"></a>
    <div>O am I wedded to death?" he cried,</div>
    <div>"Is the Dead-strand come to Whitewater side?"</div>
    <div>And the sun was fading from the room,</div>
    <div>But her eyes were bright in the change and the gloom.</div>
    <div>"Sharp sword," she sang, "and death is sure,</div>
    <div>But over all doth love endure."</div>
    <div>She stood up shining in her place</div>
    <div>And laughed beneath his deadly face.</div>
    <div>Instead of the sunbeam gleamed a brand,</div>
    <div>The hilts were hard in Hallbiorn's hand:</div>
    <div>The bitter point was in Hallgerd's breast</div>
    <div>That  Snæbiorn's lips of love had pressed.</div>
    <div>Morn and noon, and nones passed o'er,</div>
    <div>And the sun is far from the bower door.</div>
    <div>To-morrow morn shall the sun come back,</div>
    <div><i>So many times over comes summer again</i>,</div>
    <div>But Hallgerd's feet the floor shall lack.</div>

<div class="stanza">
    <div>Now Hallbiorn's house-carles ride full fast,</div>

    <div>Till many a mile of way is past.</div>
    <div><i>What healing in summer if winter be vain?</i></div>
    <div>But when they came over Oxridges,</div>
    <div>'Twas, "Where shall we give our horses ease?"</div>
    <div>When Shieldbroad-side was well in sight,</div>
    <div>'Twas, "Where shall we lay our heads to-night?"</div>
    <div>Hallbiorn turned and raised his head;</div>
    <div>"Under the stones of the waste," he said.</div>
<a name="page12" id="page12"></a>
    <div>Quoth one, "The clatter of hoofs anigh."</div>
    <div>Quoth the other, "Spears against the sky!"</div>
    <div>"Hither ride men from the Wells apace;</div>
    <div>Spur we fast to a kindlier place."</div>
    <div>Down from his horse leapt Hallbiorn straight:</div>
    <div>"Why should the supper of Odin wait?</div>
    <div>Weary and chased I will not come</div>
    <div>To the table of my fathers' home."</div>
    <div>With that came  Snæbiorn, who but he,</div>
    <div>And twelve in all was his company.</div>
    <div> Snæbiorn's folk were on their feet;</div>
    <div>He spake no word as they did meet.</div>
    <div>They fought upon the northern hill:</div>
    <div>Five are the howes men see there still.</div>
    <div>Three men of  Snæbiorn's fell to earth</div>
    <div>And Hallbiorn's twain that were of worth.</div>
    <div>And never a word did  Snæbiorn say,</div>
    <div>Till Hallbiorn's foot he smote away.</div>
    <div>Then Hallbiorn cried: "Come, fellow of mine,</div>
    <div>To the southern bent where the sun doth shine."</div>
    <div>Tottering into the sun he went,</div>
    <div>And slew two more upon the bent.</div>
    <div>And on the bent where dead he lay</div>
    <div>Three howes do men behold to-day.</div>
    <div>And never a word spake  Snæbiorn yet,</div>
    <div>Till in his saddle he was set.</div>
    <div>Nor was there any heard his voice,</div>
    <div><i>So many times over comes summer again</i></div>
    <div>Till he came to his ship in Grimsar-oyce.</div>

    <div>On so fair a day they hoisted sail,</div>
    <div><i>So many times over comes summer again</i>,</div>
    <div>And for Norway well did the wind avail.</div>
    <div><i>What healing in summer if winter be vain?</i></div>
    <div>But  Snæbiorn looked aloft and said:</div>
    <div>"I see in the sail a stripe of red:</div>
    <div>Murder, meseems, is the name of it,</div>
    <div>And ugly things about it flit.</div>
    <div>A stripe of blue in the sail I see:</div>
    <div>Cold death of men it seems to me.</div>
    <div>And next I see a stripe of black,</div>
    <div>For a life fulfilled of bitter lack."</div>
    <div>Quoth one, "So fair a wind doth blow</div>
    <div>That we shall see Norway soon enow."</div>
    <div>"Be blithe, O shipmate,"  Snæbiorn said,</div>
    <div>"Tell Hacon the Earl that I be dead."</div>
    <div>About the midst of the Iceland main</div>
    <div>Round veered the wind to the east again.</div>
    <div>And west they drave, and long they ran</div>
    <div>Till they saw a land was white and wan.</div>
    <div>"Yea,"  Snæbiorn said, "my home it is,</div>
    <div>Ye bear a man shall have no bliss.</div>
    <div>Far off beside the Greekish sea</div>
    <div>The maidens pluck the grapes in glee.</div>
    <div>Green groweth the wheat in the English land,</div>
    <div>And the honey-bee flieth on every hand.</div>
    <div>In Norway by the cheaping town</div>

    <div>But these are Gunnbiorn's skerries wan,</div>
    <div>Meet harbour for a hapless man.</div>
    <div>In all lands else is love alive,</div>
    <div>But here is nought with grief to strive.</div>
    <div>Fail not for a while, O eastern wind,</div>
    <div>For nought but grief is left behind.</div>
    <div>And before me here a rest I know,"</div>

    <div>Mock not the tide when hope is dead!"</div>
    <div>I bless thee, O my love, who say'st:</div>
    <div>"Mock not the thistle-cumbered waste;</div>
    <div>I hold Love's hand, and make no haste</div>
    <div>Down the long way, now hope is dead.</div>
    <div>With other names do we name pain,</div>
    <div>The long years wear our hearts in vain.</div>
    <div>Mock not our loss grown into gain,</div>
    <div>Mock not our lost hope lying dead.</div>
    <div>Our eyes gaze for no morning-star,</div>
    <div>No glimmer of the dawn afar;</div>
    <div>Full silent wayfarers we are</div>
    <div>Since ere the noon-tide hope lay dead.</div>

<div class="stanza">
    <div>Upon an eve I sat me down and wept,</div>
    <div>Because the world to me seemed nowise good;</div>
    <div>Still autumn was it, and the meadows slept,</div>
    <div>The misty hills dreamed, and the silent wood</div>
    <div>Seemed listening to the sorrow of my mood:</div>
    <div>I knew not if the earth with me did grieve,</div>
    <div>Or if it mocked my grief that bitter eve.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then 'twixt my tears a maiden did I see,</div>
    <div>Who drew anigh me on the leaf-strewn grass,</div>
    <div>Then stood and gazed upon me pitifully</div>
    <div>With grief-worn eyes, until my woe did pass</div>
    <div>From me to her, and tearless now I was,</div>
    <div>And she mid tears was asking me of one</div>
    <div>She long had sought unaided and alone.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>I knew not of him, and she turned away</div>
    <div>Into the dark wood, and my own great pain</div>
    <div>Still held me there, till dark had slain the day,</div>
    <div>And perished at the grey dawn's hand again;</div>
    <div>Then from the wood a voice cried: "Ah, in vain,</div>
    <div>In vain I seek thee, O thou bitter-sweet!</div>
    <div>In what lone land are set thy longed-for feet?"</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page22" id="page22"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then I looked up, and lo, a man there came</div>
    <div>From midst the trees, and stood regarding me</div>
    <div>Until my tears were dried for very shame;</div>
    <div>Then he cried out: "O mourner, where is she</div>
    <div>Whom I have sought o'er every land and sea?</div>
    <div>I love her and she loveth me, and still</div>
    <div>We meet no more than green hill meeteth hill."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>With that he passed on sadly, and I knew</div>
    <div>That these had met and missed in the dark night,</div>
    <div>Blinded by blindness of the world untrue,</div>
    <div>That hideth love and maketh wrong of right.</div>
    <div>Then midst my pity for their lost delight,</div>
    <div>Yet more with barren longing I grew weak,</div>
    <div>Yet more I mourned that I had none to seek.</div>

<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Earth's fragrance went with her, as in the wet grass,</div>

<div class="stanza">
    <div>The days have slain the days,</div>
    <div>and the seasons have gone by</div>
    <div>And brought me the summer again;</div>
    <div>and here on the grass I lie</div>
    <div>As erst I lay and was glad</div>
    <div>ere I meddled with right and with wrong.</div>
    <div>Wide lies the mead as of old,</div>
    <div>and the river is creeping along</div>
    <div>By the side of the elm-clad bank</div>
    <div>that turns its weedy stream;</div>
    <div>And grey o'er its hither lip</div>
    <div>the quivering rashes gleam.</div>
    <div>There is work in the mead as of old;</div>
    <div>they are eager at winning the hay,</div>
    <div>While every sun sets bright</div>
    <div>and begets a fairer day.</div>
    <div>The forks shine white in the sun</div>
    <div>round the yellow red-wheeled wain,</div>
    <div>Where the mountain of hay grows fast;</div>
    <div>and now from out of the lane</div>
    <div>Comes the ox-team drawing another,</div>
    <div>comes the bailiff and the beer,</div>
<a name="page152" id="page152"></a>
    <div>And thump, thump, goes the farmer's nag</div>
    <div>o'er the narrow bridge of the weir.</div>
    <div>High up and light are the clouds,</div>
    <div>and though the swallows flit</div>
    <div>So high o'er the sunlit earth,</div>
    <div>they are well a part of it,</div>
    <div>And so, though high over them,</div>
    <div>are the wings of the wandering herne;</div>
    <div>In measureless depths above him</div>
    <div>doth the fair sky quiver and burn;</div>
    <div>The dear sun floods the land</div>
    <div>as the morning falls toward noon,</div>
    <div>And a little wind is awake</div>
    <div>in the best of the latter June.</div>
    <div>They are busy winning the hay,</div>
    <div>and the life and the picture they make</div>
    <div>If I were as once I was,</div>
    <div>I should deem it made for my sake;</div>
    <div>For here if one need not work</div>
    <div>is a place for happy rest,</div>

    <div>north, south, and east and west.</div>

<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then was the Queen's word wailing-wild:</div>

    <div>Thou shalt sit by my groom till the dawn of night,</div>

    <div>She swore the oath, and then she spake:</div>

    <div>As if in the clearing of the wood</div>
    <div>One gave him bread and apples good;</div>

</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Yet saw he betwixt board and door,</div>
    <div>A slim maid tread the chequered floor.</div>

    <div>Her gown of green so fair was wrought,</div>

    <div>A basket in her hand had she.</div>

<div class="stanza">
    <div>Love floated round her, and her eyes</div>

<div class="stanza">
    <div>Now Goldilocks she sat beside,</div>

    <div>The Queen smiled o'er the guest-rich board,</div>

    <div>And heeded nought the Angel's child,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>For like an image fashioned fair</div>
    <div>Still sat the Swain with empty stare.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>These words seemed spoken not, but writ</div>
    <div>As foolish tales through night-dreams flit.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Vague pictures passed before his sight,</div>
    <div>As in the first dream of the night.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>But the Maiden opened her basket fair,</div>
    <div>And set two doves on the table there.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And soft they cooed, and sweet they billed</div>
    <div>Like man and maid with love fulfilled.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Therewith the Maiden reached a hand</div>
    <div>To a dish that on the board did stand;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And she crumbled a share of the spice-loaf brown,</div>
    <div>And the Swain upon her hand looked down;</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page207" id="page207"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then unto the fowl his eyes he turned;</div>
    <div>And as in a dream his bowels yearned</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>For somewhat that he could not name;</div>
    <div>And into his heart a hope there came.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And still he looked on the hands of the Maid,</div>
    <div>As before the fowl the crumbs she laid.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And he murmured low, "O Goldilocks!</div>
    <div>Were we but amid the wheaten shocks!"</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then the false Queen knit her brows and laid</div>
    <div>A fair white hand by the hand of the Maid.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>He turned his eyes away thereat,</div>
    <div>And closer to the Maiden sat.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>But the queen-bird now the carle-bird fed</div>
    <div>Till all was gone of the sugared bread.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then with wheedling voice for more he craved,</div>
    <div>And the Maid a share from the spice-loaf shaved;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And the crumbs within her hollow hand</div>
    <div>She held where the creeping doves did stand.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>But Goldilocks, he looked and longed,</div>
    <div>And saw how the carle the queen-bird wronged.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>For when she came to the hand to eat</div>
    <div>The hungry queen-bird thence he beat.</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page208" id="page208"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then Goldilocks the Swain spake low:</div>
    <div>"Foul fall thee, bird, thou doest now</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>As I to Goldilocks, my sweet,</div>
    <div>Who gave my hungry mouth to eat."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>He felt her hand as he did speak,</div>
    <div>He felt her face against his cheek.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>He turned and stood in the evil hall,</div>
    <div>And swept her up in arms withal.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then was there hubbub wild and strange,</div>
    <div>And swiftly all things there 'gan change.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>The fair Queen into a troll was grown,</div>
    <div>A one-eyed, bow-backed, haggard crone.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And though the hall was yet full fair,</div>
    <div>And bright the sunshine streamed in there,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>On evil shapes it fell forsooth:</div>
    <div>Swine-heads; small red eyes void of ruth;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And bare-boned bodies of vile things,</div>
    <div>And evil-feathered bat-felled wings.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And all these mopped and mowed and grinned,</div>
    <div>And sent strange noises down the wind.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>There stood those twain unchanged alone</div>
    <div>To face the horror of the crone;</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page209" id="page209"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>She crouched against them by the board;</div>
    <div>And cried the Maid: "Thy sword, thy sword!</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Thy sword, O Goldilocks! For see</div>
    <div>She will not keep her oath to me."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Out flashed the blade therewith. He saw</div>
    <div>The foul thing sidelong toward them draw,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Holding within her hand a cup</div>
    <div>Wherein some dreadful drink seethed up.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then Goldilocks cried out and smote,</div>
    <div>And the sharp blade sheared the evil throat.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>The head fell noseling to the floor;</div>
    <div>The liquor from the cup did pour,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And ran along a sparkling flame</div>
    <div>That nigh unto their footsoles came.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then empty straightway was the hall,</div>
    <div>Save for those twain, and she withal.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>So fled away the Maid and Man,</div>
    <div>And down the stony stairway ran.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Fast fled they o'er the sunny grass,</div>
    <div>Yet but a little way did pass</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Ere cried the Maid: "Now cometh forth</div>
    <div>The snow-white ice-bear of the North;</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page210" id="page210"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Turn, Goldilocks, and heave up sword!"</div>
    <div>Then fast he stood upon the sward,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And faced the beast, that whined and cried,</div>
    <div>And shook his head from side to side.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>But round him the Swain danced and leaped,</div>
    <div>And soon the grisly head he reaped.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And then the ancient blade he sheathed,</div>
    <div>And ran unto his love sweet-breathed;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And caught her in his arms and ran</div>
    <div>Fast from that house, the bane of man.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Yet therewithal he spake her soft</div>
    <div>And kissed her over oft and oft,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Until from kissed and trembling mouth</div>
    <div>She cried: "The Dragon of the South!"</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>He set her down and turned about,</div>
    <div>And drew the eager edges out.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And therewith scaly coil on coil</div>
    <div>Reared 'gainst his face the mouth aboil:</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>The gaping jaw and teeth of dread</div>
    <div>Was dark 'twixt heaven and his head.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>But with no fear, no thought, no word,</div>
    <div>He thrust the thin-edged ancient sword.</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page211" id="page211"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And the hot blood ran from the hairy throat,</div>
    <div>And set the summer grass afloat.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then back he turned and caught her hand,</div>
    <div>And never a minute did they stand.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>But as they ran on toward the wood,</div>
    <div>He deemed her swift feet fair and good.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>She looked back o'er her shoulder fair:</div>
    <div>"The whelming poison-pool is here;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And now availeth nought the blade:</div>
    <div>O if my cherished trees might aid!</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>But now my feet fail. Leave me then!</div>
    <div>And hold my memory dear of men."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>He caught her in his arms again;</div>
    <div>Of her dear side was he full fain.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Her body in his arms was dear:</div>
    <div>"Sweet art thou, though we perish here!"</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Like quicksilver came on the flood:</div>
    <div>But lo, the borders of the wood!</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>She slid from out his arms and stayed;</div>
    <div>Round a great oak her arms she laid.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>"If e'er I saved thee, lovely tree,</div>
    <div>From axe and saw, now succour me:</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page212" id="page212"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Look how the venom creeps anigh,</div>
    <div>Help! lest thou see me writhe and die."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>She crouched beside the upheaved root,</div>
    <div>The bubbling venom touched her foot;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then with a sucking gasping sound</div>
    <div>It ebbed back o'er the blighted ground.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Up then she rose and took his hand</div>
    <div>And never a moment did they stand.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>"Come, love," she cried, "the ways I know,</div>
    <div>How thick soe'er the thickets grow.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>O love, I love thee! O thine heart!</div>
    <div>How mighty and how kind thou art!"</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Therewith they saw the tree-dusk lit,</div>
    <div>Bright grey the great boles gleamed on it.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>"O flee," she said, "the sword is nought</div>
    <div>Against the flickering fire-flaught."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>"But this availeth yet," said he,</div>
    <div>"That Hallows All our love may see."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>He turned about and faced the glare:</div>
    <div>"O Mother, help us, kind and fair!</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Now help me, true St. Nicholas,</div>
    <div>If ever truly thine I was!"</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page213" id="page213"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Therewith the wild-fire waned and paled,</div>
    <div>And in the wood the light nigh failed;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And all about 'twas as the night.</div>
    <div>He said: "Now won is all our fight,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And now meseems all were but good</div>
    <div>If thou mightst bring us from the wood."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>She fawned upon him, face and breast;</div>
    <div>She said: "It hangs 'twixt worst and best.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And yet, O love, if thou be true,</div>
    <div>One thing alone thou hast to do."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Sweetly he kissed her, cheek and chin:</div>
    <div>"What work thou biddest will I win."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>"O love, my love, I needs must sleep;</div>
    <div>Wilt thou my slumbering body keep,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And, toiling sorely, still bear on</div>
    <div>The love thou seemest to have won?"</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>"O easy toil," he said, "to bless</div>
    <div>Mine arms with all thy loveliness."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>She smiled; "Yea, easy it may seem,</div>
    <div>But harder is it than ye deem.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>For hearken! Whatso thou mayst see,</div>
    <div>Piteous as it may seem to thee,</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page214" id="page214"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Heed not nor hearken! bear me forth,</div>
    <div>As though nought else were aught of worth.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>For all earth's wealth that may be found</div>
    <div>Lay me not sleeping on the ground,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>To help, to hinder, or to save!</div>
    <div>Or there for me thou diggest a grave."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>He took her body on his arm,</div>
    <div>Her slumbering head lay on his barm.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then glad he bore her on the way,</div>
    <div>And the wood grew lighter with the day.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>All still it was, till suddenly</div>
    <div>He heard a bitter wail near by.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Yet on he went until he heard</div>
    <div>The cry become a shapen word:</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>"Help me, O help, thou passer by!</div>
    <div>Turn from the path, let me not die!</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>I am a woman; bound and left</div>
    <div>To perish; of all help bereft."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then died the voice out in a moan;</div>
    <div>He looked upon his love, his own,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And minding all she spake to him</div>
    <div>Strode onward through the wild-wood dim.</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page215" id="page215"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>But lighter grew the woodland green</div>
    <div>Till clear the shapes of things were seen.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And therewith wild halloos he heard,</div>
    <div>And shrieks, and cries of one afeard.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Nigher it grew and yet more nigh</div>
    <div>Till burst from out a brake near by</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>A woman bare of breast and limb,</div>
    <div>Who turned a piteous face to him</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>E'en as she ran: for hard at heel</div>
    <div>Followed a man with brandished steel,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And yelling mouth. Then the Swain stood</div>
    <div>One moment in the glimmering wood</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Trembling, ashamed: Yet now grown wise</div>
    <div>Deemed all a snare for ears and eyes.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>So onward swiftlier still he strode</div>
    <div>And cast all thought on his fair load.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And yet in but a little space</div>
    <div>Back came the yelling shrieking chase,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And well-nigh gripped now by the man,</div>
    <div>Straight unto him the woman ran;</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And underneath the gleaming steel</div>
    <div>E'en at his very feet did kneel.</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page216" id="page216"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>She looked up; sobs were all her speech,</div>
    <div>Yet sorely did her face beseech.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>While o'er her head the chaser stared,</div>
    <div>Shaking aloft the edges bared.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Doubted the Swain, and a while did stand</div>
    <div>As she took his coat-lap in her hand.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Upon his hand he felt her breath</div>
    <div>Hot with the dread of present death.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Sleek was her arm on his scarlet coat,</div>
    <div>The sobbing passion rose in his throat.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>But e'en therewith he looked aside</div>
    <div>And saw the face of the sleeping bride.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then he tore his coat from the woman's hand,</div>
    <div>And never a moment there did stand.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>But swiftly thence away he strode</div>
    <div>Along the dusky forest road.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And there rose behind him laughter shrill,</div>
    <div>And then was the windless wood all still,</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>He looked around o'er all the place,</div>
    <div>But saw no image of the chase.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And as he looked the night-mirk now</div>
    <div>O'er all the tangled wood 'gan flow.</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page217" id="page217"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Then stirred the sweetling that he bore,</div>
    <div>And she slid adown from his arms once more.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Nought might he see her well-loved face;</div>
    <div>But he felt her lips in the mirky place.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>"'Tis night," she said, "and the false day's gone,</div>
    <div>And we twain in the wild-wood all alone.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Night o'er the earth; so rest we here</div>
    <div>Until to-morrow's sun is clear.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>For overcome is every foe</div>
    <div>And home to-morrow shall we go."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>So 'neath the trees they lay, those twain,</div>
    <div>And to them the darksome night was gain.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>But when the morrow's dawn was grey</div>
    <div>They woke and kissed whereas they lay.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And when on their feet they came to stand</div>
    <div>Swain Goldilocks stretched out his hand.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And he spake: "O love, my love indeed,</div>
    <div>Where now is gone thy goodly weed?</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>For again thy naked feet I see,</div>
    <div>And thy sweet sleek arms so kind to me.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Through thy rent kirtle once again</div>
    <div>Thy shining shoulder showeth plain."</div>
</div>
<br />
<a name="page218" id="page218"></a>
<div class="stanza">
    <div>She blushed as red as the sun-sweet rose:</div>
    <div>"My garments gay were e'en of those</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>That the false Queen dight to slay my heart;</div>
    <div>And sore indeed was their fleshly smart.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Yet must I bear them, well-beloved,</div>
    <div>Until thy truth and troth was proved</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>And this tattered coat is now for a sign</div>
    <div>That thou hast won me to be thine.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>Now wilt thou lead along thy maid</div>
    <div>To meet thy kindred unafraid."</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>As stoops the falcon on the dove</div>
    <div>He cast himself about her love.</div>
</div>
<br />
<div class="stanza">
    <div>He kissed her over, cheek and chin,</div>
    <div>He kissed the sweetness of her skin.</div>
</div>
<br />

found this also, that he had enough, though he lacked all else.</p>

    <p>Nay, they bade lead him to hunt and to tilting,<br />
    To set him on high in the throne of his honour<br />
    To judge heavy deeds: bade him handle the tiller,<br />
    And drive through the sea with the wind at its wildest;<br />
    All things he was wont to hold kingly and good.<br />
    So we led out his steed and he straight leapt upon him<br />
    With no word, and no looking to right nor to left,<br />
    And into the forest we fared as aforetime:<br />
    Fast on the king followed, and cheered without stinting<br />
    The hounds to the strife till the bear stood at bay;<br />
    Then there he alone by the beech-trees alighted;<br />
    Barehanded, unarmoured, he handled the spear-shaft,<br />
    And blew up the death on the horn of his father;<br />
    Yet still in his eyes was no look of rejoicing,<br />
    And no life in his lips; but I likened him rather<br />
    To King Nimrod carved fair on the back of the high-seat<br />
    When the candles are dying, and the high moon is streaming<br />
    Through window and luffer white on the lone pavement<br />
    Whence the guests are departed in the hall of the

    He looked not aloft as they hoisted the sail,<br />
    But with hand on the tiller hallooed to the shipmen<br />
    In a voice grown so strange, that it scarce had seemed
    stranger<br />
    If from the ship Argo, in seemly wise woven<br />
    On the guard-chamber hangings, some early grey dawning<br />
    Great Jason had cried, and his golden locks wavered.<br />
    Then e'en as the oars ran outboard, and dashed<br />
    In the wind-scattered foam and the sails bellied out,<br />
    His hand dropped from the tiller, and with feet all
    uncertain<br />
    And dull eye he wended him down to the midship,<br />
    And gazing about for the place of the gangway<br />
    Made for the gate of the bulwark half open,<br />
    And stood there and stared at the swallowing sea,<br />
    Then turned, and uncertain went wandering back sternward,<br />
    And sat down on the deck by the side of the helmsman,<br />
    Wrapt in dreams of despair; so I bade them turn shoreward,<br />
    And slowly he rose as the side grated stoutly<br />
    'Gainst the stones of the quay and they cast forth the

    <p>We bade gather the knights for the goodliest tilting,<br />

    In the old arms we armed him whose dints well he knew<br />
    That the night dew had dulled and the sea salt had sullied:<br />
    On the old roan yet sturdy we set him astride;<br />
    So he stretched forth his hand to lay hold of the spear<br />
    Neither laughing nor frowning, as lightly his wont was<br />
    When the knights are awaiting the voice of the trumpet.<br />
    It awoke, and back beaten from barrier to barrier<br />
    Was caught up by knights' cries, by the cry of the
    king.&mdash;<br />
    &mdash;Such a cry as red Mars in the Council-room window<br />
    May awake with some noon when the last horn is winded,<br />
    And the bones of the world are dashed grinding together.<br />
    So it seemed to my heart, and a horror came o'er me,<br />
    As the spears met, and splinters flew high o'er the field,<br />
    And I saw the king stay when his course was at swiftest,<br />
    His horse straining hard on the bit, and he standing<br />
    Stiff and stark in his stirrups, his spear held by the
    midmost,<br />
    His helm cast a-back, his teeth set hard together;<br />
    E'en as one might, who, riding to heaven, feels round him<br />
    The devils unseen: then he raised up the spear<br />
    As to cast it away, but therewith failed his fury,<br />
<a name="page244" id="page244"></a>
    He dropped it, and faintly sank back in the saddle,<br />
    And, turning his horse from the press and the turmoil,<br />
    Came sighing to me, and sore grieving I took him<br />
    And led him away, while the lists were fallen silent<br />
    As a fight in a dream that the light breaketh
    through.&mdash;<br />
    To the tune of the clinking of his fight-honoured armour<br />

    As a grim tale was told there of the griefs of the lowly;<br />

    Pity midst anger, hope midst scorn and hate.<br />
    Languor midst labour, lest the day wax late,<br />
    And all be wrong, and all be to begin.<br />
    Through these indeed the eager life did win<br />
    That was the very body to my soul;<br />

    Before his patience: as he toiled and grieved<br />
    O'er fools and folly, was he not deceived,<br />

    And in my mirror gazed with steadfast eye.<br />
    Still, O my Faithful, seemed his life so fair<br />

    That he at last may save his soul alive.</p>

    On my love of the land and the longing I cherished<br />
    For a tale to be told when I, laid in the minster,<br />
    Might hear it no more; was it easy of winning,<br />

    Blest all times of rest, rent the battle asunder,<br />

    Side by side did we wend down the pass: the wind tangled<br />
    Mid the trunks and black boughs made wild music about us,<br />
    But her feet on the scant snow and the sound of her breathing<br />
    Made music much better: the wood thinned, and I saw her,<br />
    As we came to the brow of the pass; for the moon gleamed<br />
    Bitter cold in the cloudless black sky of the winter.<br />
    Then the world drew me back from my love, and departing<br />
    I saw her sweet serious look pass into terror<br />
    And her arms cast abroad&mdash;and lo, clashing of armour,<br />
    And a sword in my hand, and my mouth crying loud,<br />

    And still through all longing I young in Love's dealings,<br />
    Never called it a pain: though, the battle passed over,<br />
    The council determined, back again came my craving:<br />
    I knew not the pain, but I knew all the pleasure,<br />
    When now, as the clouds o'er my fortune were parting,<br />
    I felt myself waxing in might and in wisdom;<br />

    Eat his meat by my side and drink out of my beaker,<br />
    In memory of days when my meat was but little<br />
    And my drink drunk in haste between saddle and straw.<br />
    But lo! midst of my triumph, as I noted the feigning<br />
    Of the last foeman humbled, and the hall fell a murmuring,<br />
    And blithely the horns blew, <i>Be glad, spring
    prevaileth,</i><br />
    &mdash;As I sat there and changed not, my soul saw a vision:<br />
    All folk faded away, and my love that I long for<br />
    Came with raiment a-rustling along the hall pavement,<br />
    Drawing near to the high-seat, with hands held out a little,<br />
    Till her hallowed eyes drew me a space into heaven,<br />
    And her lips moved to whisper, 'Come, love, for I weary!'<br />
    Then she turned and went from me, and I heard her feet
    falling<br />
    On the floor of the hall, e'en as though it were empty<br />
    Of all folk but us twain in the hush of the dawning.<br />
    Then again, all was gone, and I sat there a smiling<br />
    On the faint-smiling legate, as the hall windows quivered<br />
    With the rain of the early night sweeping across them.<br />
    Nought slept I that night, yet I saw her without
    sleeping:&mdash;<br />
    Betwixt midnight and morn of that summer-tide was I<br />
    Amidst of the lilies by her house-door to hearken<br />
    If perchance in her chamber she turned amid sleeping:<br />
    When lo, as the East 'gan to change, and stars faded<br />
    Were her feet on the stairs, and the door opened softly,<br />
    And she stood on the threshold with the eyes of one seeking,<br />
<a name="page264" id="page264"></a>
    And there, gathering the folds of her gown to her girdle,<br />
    Went forth through the garden and followed the highway,<br />
    All along the green valley, and I ever beside her,<br />
    Till the light of the low sun just risen was falling<br />
    On her feet in the first of the pass&mdash;and all faded.<br />
    Yet from her unto me had gone forth her intent,<br />
    And I saw her face set to the heart of that city,<br />
    And the quays where the ships of the outlanders come to,<br />
    And I said: She is seeking, and shall I not seek?<br />
    The sea is her prison wall; where is my prison?<br />
    &mdash;Yet I said: Here men praise me, perchance men may love
    me<br />
    If I live long enough for my justice and mercy<br />
    To make them just and merciful&mdash;one who is master<br />
    Of many poor folk, a man pity moveth<br />
    Love hath dealt with in this wise, no minstrel nor dreamer.<br />
    The deeds that my hand might find for the doing<br />
    Did desire undo them these four years of fight?<br />
    And now time and fair peace in my heart have begotten<br />
    More desire and more pain, is the day of deeds done with?<br />
    Lo here for my part my bonds and my prison!&mdash;<br />
    Then with hands holding praise, yet with fierce heart belike<br />
    Did I turn to the people that I had delivered&mdash;<br />
    And the deeds of this year passed shall live peradventure!<br />
    But now came no solace of dreams in the night-tide<br />
    From that day thenceforward; yet oft in the council,<br />
    Mid the hearkening folk craving for justice or mercy,<br />
    Mid the righting of wrongs and the staying of ruin,<br />
    Mid the ruling a dull folk, who deemed all my kingship<br />
    A thing due and easy as the dawning and sunset<br />
<a name="page265" id="page265"></a>
    To the day that God made once to deal with no further&mdash;<br />
    &mdash;Mid all these a fair face, a sad face, could I
    fashion,<br />
    And I said, She is seeking, and shall I not seek?<br />
    &mdash;Tell over the days of the year of hope's waning;<br />
    Tell over the hours of the weary days wearing:<br />

    <p>That double life my faithful king has led<br />
    My hand has untwined, and old days are dead<br />
    As in the moon the sails run up the mast.<br />
    Yea, let this present mingle with the past,<br />
    And when ye see him next think a long tide<br />
    Of days are gone by; for the world is wide,<br />
    And if at last these hands, these lips shall meet,<br />
    What matter thorny ways and weary feet?</p>

    <p>A faithful king, and now grown wise in love:<br />
    Yet from of old in many ways I move<br />
    The hearts that shall be mine: him by the hand<br />
    Have I led forth, and shown his eyes the land<br />
    Where dwells his love, and shown him what she is:<br />
    He has beheld the lips that he shall kiss,<br />
    The eyes his eyes shall soften, and the cheek<br />
    His voice shall change, the limbs he maketh weak:<br />
    &mdash;All this he hath as in a picture wrought&mdash;<br />
    But lo you, 'tis the seeker and the sought:<br />
    For her no marvels of the night I make,<br />
    Nor keep my dream-smiths' drowsy heads awake;<br />
    Only about her have I shed a glory<br />
    Whereby she waiteth trembling for a story<br />
    That she shall play in,&mdash;and 'tis not begun:<br />
    Therefore from rising sun to setting sun<br />
<a name="page271" id="page271"></a>
    There flit before her half-formed images<br />
    Of what I am, and in all things she sees<br />
    Something of mine: so single is her heart<br />
    Filled with the worship of one set apart<br />
    To be my priestess through all joy and sorrow;<br />
    So sad and sweet she waits the certain morrow.<br />
    &mdash;And yet sometimes, although her heart be strong,<br />
    You may well think I tarry over-long:<br />
    The lonely sweetness of desire grows pain,<br />
    The reverent life of longing void and vain:<br />
    Then are my dream-smiths mindful of my lore:<br />
    They weave a web of sighs and weeping sore,<br />
    Of languor, and of very helplessness,<br />
    Of restless wandering, lonely dumb distress,<br />
    Till like a live thing there she stands and goes,<br />
    Gazing at Pharamond through all her woes.<br />
    Then forth they fly, and spread the picture out<br />
    Before his eyes, and how then may he doubt<br />
    She knows his life, his deeds, and his desire?<br />
    How shall he tremble lest her heart should tire?<br />
    &mdash;It is not so; his danger and his war,<br />
    His days of triumph, and his years of care,<br />
    She knows them not&mdash;yet shall she know some day<br />
    The love that in his lonely longing lay.</p>

    <p>What, Faithful&mdash;do I lie, that overshot<br />
    My dream-web is with that which happeneth not?<br />
    Nay, nay, believe it not!&mdash;love lies alone<br />
    In loving hearts like fire within the stone:<br />
<a name="page272" id="page272"></a>
    Then strikes my hand, and lo, the flax ablaze!<br />
    &mdash;Those tales of empty striving, and lost days<br />
    Folk tell of sometimes&mdash;never lit my fire<br />
    Such ruin as this; but Pride and Vain-desire,<br />
    My counterfeits and foes, have done the deed.<br />
    Beware, beloved! for they sow the weed<br />
    Where I the wheat: they meddle where I leave,<br />
    Take what I scorn, cast by what I receive,<br />
    Sunder my yoke, yoke that I would dissever,<br />
    Pull down the house my hands would build for ever.</p>

    <p>How is it with the Fosterer then, when he<br />
    Comes back again that rest and peace to see,<br />
    And God his latest prayer has granted now?&mdash;<br />
    Why, as the winds whereso they list shall blow,<br />
    So drifts the thought of man, and who shall say<br />
    To-morrow shall my thought be as to-day?<br />
    &mdash;My fosterling is happy, and I too;<br />
    Yet did we leave behind things good to do,<br />
    Deeds good to tell about when we are dead.<br />
    Here is no pain, but rest, and easy bread;<br />
    Yet therewith something hard to understand<br />
    Dulls the crowned work to which I set my hand.<br />
    Ah, patience yet! his longing is well won,<br />
    And I shall die at last and all be done.&mdash;<br />
    Such words unspoken the best man on earth<br />
    Still bears about betwixt the lover's mirth;<br />
    And now he hath what he went forth to find,<br />
    This Pharamond is neither dull nor blind,<br />
    And looking upon Oliver, he saith:&mdash;<br />
    My friend recked nothing of his life or death,<br />
    Knew not my anguish then, nor now my pleasure,<br />
    And by my crowned joy sets his lessened treasure.<br />
    Is risk of twenty days of wind and sea,<br />
    Of new-born feeble headless enmity,<br />
<a name="page309" id="page309"></a>
    I should have scorned once, too great gift to give<br />
    To this most faithful man that he may live?</p>

    <p>&mdash;Yea, was that all? my faithful, you and I,<br />
    Still craving, scorn the world too utterly,<br />
    The world we want not&mdash;yet, our one desire<br />
    Fulfilled at last, what next shall feed the fire?<br />
    &mdash;I say not this to make my altar cold;<br />
    Rather that ye, my happy ones, should hold<br />
    Enough of memory and enough of fear<br />
    Within your hearts to keep its flame full clear;<br />
    Rather that ye, still dearer to my heart,<br />
    Whom words call hapless, yet should praise your part,<br />
    Wherein the morning and the evening sun<br />
    Are bright about a story never done;<br />
    That those for chastening, these for joy should cling<br />
    About the marvels that my minstrels sing.</p>

    <p>Well, Pharamond fulfilled of love must turn<br />
    Unto the folk that still he deemed would yearn<br />
    To see his face, and hear his voice once more;<br />
    And he was mindful of the days passed o'er,<br />
    And fain had linked them to these days of love;<br />
    And he perchance was fain the world to move<br />
    While love looked on; and he perchance was fain<br />
    Some pleasure of the strife of old to gain.<br />
    Easy withal it seemed to him to land,<br />
    And by his empty throne awhile to stand<br />
    Amid the wonder, and then sit him down<br />
    While folk went forth to seek the hidden crown.</p>
<a name="page310" id="page310"></a>
    <p>Or else his name upon the same wind borne<br />
    As smote the world with winding of his horn,<br />
    His hood pulled back, his banner flung abroad,<br />
    A gleam of sunshine on his half-drawn sword.<br />
    &mdash;Well, he and you and I have little skill<br />
    To know the secret of Fate's worldly will;<br />
    Yet can I guess, and you belike may guess,<br />
    Yea, and e'en he mid all his lordliness,<br />
    That much may be forgot in three years' space<br />
    Outside my kingdom.&mdash;Gone his godlike face,<br />
    His calm voice, and his kindness, half akin<br />
    Amid a blind folk to rebuke of sin,<br />
    Men 'gin to think that he was great and good,<br />
    But hindered them from doing as they would,<br />
    And ere they have much time to think on it<br />
    Between their teeth another has the bit,<br />
    And forth they run with Force and Fate behind.<br />
    &mdash;Indeed his sword might somewhat heal the blind,<br />
    Were I not, and the softness I have given;<br />
    With me for him have hope and glory striven<br />
    In other days when my tale was beginning;<br />
    But sweet life lay beyond then for the winning,<br />
    And now what sweetness?&mdash;blood of men to spill<br />
    Who once believed him God to heal their ill:<br />
    To break the gate and storm adown the street<br />
    Where once his coming flower-crowned girls did greet:<br />
    To deem the cry come from amidst his folk<br />
    When his own country tongue should curse his stroke&mdash;<br />
    Nay, he shall leave to better men or worse<br />
    His people's conquered homage and their curse.</p>
<a name="page311" id="page311"></a>
    <p>So forth they go, his Oliver and he,<br />
    One thing at least to learn across the sea,<br />
    That whatso needless shadows life may borrow<br />
    Love is enough amidst of joy or sorrow.</p>

    <p>Love is enough&mdash;My Faithful, in your eyes<br />
    I see the thought, Our Lord is overwise<br />
    Some minutes past in what concerns him not,<br />
    And us no more: is all his tale forgot?<br />
    &mdash;Ah, Well-beloved, I fell asleep e'en now,<br />
    And in my sleep some enemy did show<br />
    Sad ghosts of bitter things, and names unknown<br />
    For things I know&mdash;a maze with shame bestrown<br />
    And ruin and death; till e'en myself did seem<br />
    A wandering curse amidst a hopeless dream.<br />
    &mdash;Yet see! I live, no older than of old,<br />
    What tales soe'er of changing Time has told.<br />
    And ye who cling to all my hand shall give,<br />
    Sorrow or joy, no less than I shall live.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">A long time it seems since this morn
    when I met them,<br />
    The men of my household and the great man they honour:<br />
    Better counsel in king-choosing might I have given<br />
    Had ye bided my coming back hither, my people:<br />
    And yet who shall say or foretell what Fate meaneth?<br />
    For that man there, the stranger, Honorius men called him,<br />
    I account him the soul to King Theobald's body,<br />
    And the twain are one king; and a goodly king may be<br />
    For this people, who grasping at peace and good days,<br />
    Careth little who giveth them that which they long for.<br />
    Yet what gifts have I given them; I who this even<br />
    Turn away with grim face from the fight that should try me?<br />
    It is just then, I have lost: lie down, thou supplanter,<br />
    In thy tomb in the minster when thy life is well over,<br />
    And the well-carven image of latten laid o'er thee<br />
    Shall live on as thou livedst, and be worthy the praising<br />
    Whereby folk shall remember the days of thy plenty.<br />
    Praising Theobald the Good and the peace that he brought
    them,<br />
    But I&mdash;I shall live too, though no graven image<br />
    On the grass of the hillside shall brave the storms' beating;<br />
    Though through days of thy plenty the people remember<br />
    As a dim time of war the past days of King Pharamond;<br />
    Yet belike as time weareth, and folk turn back a little<br />
    To the darkness where dreams lie and live on for ever,<br />
<a name="page313" id="page313"></a>
    Even there shall be Pharamond who failed not in battle,<br />
    But feared to overcome his folk who forgot him,<br />
    And turned back and left them a tale for the telling,<br />
    A song for the singing, that yet in some battle<br />
    May grow to remembrance and rend through the ruin<br />
    As my sword rent it through in the days gone for ever.<br />
    So, like Enoch of old, I was not, for God took me.<br />

    Did I kneel to his white lips and sword-cloven bosom,<br />

    For a furlong before us the spear-wood was glistening.<br />
    I was king of this city when here where we stand now<br />
    Amidst a grim silence I mustered all men folk<br />
    Who might yet bear a weapon; and no brawl of kings was it<br />
    That brought war on the city, and silenced the markets<br />
    And cumbered the haven with crowd of masts sailless,<br />
    But great countries arisen for our ruin and downfall.<br />
    I was king of the land, when on all roads were riding<br />
    The legates of proud princes to pray help and give
    service&mdash;<br />
    Yea, I was a great king at last as I sat there,<br />
    Peace spread far about me, and the love of all people<br />
    To my palace gates wafted by each wind of the heavens.<br />
    &mdash;And where sought I all this? with what price did I buy
    it?<br />
    Nay, for thou knowest that this fair fame and fortune<br />
    Came stealing soft-footed to give their gifts to me:<br />
    And shall I, who was king once, grow griping and weary<br />
    In unclosing the clenched fists of niggards who hold them,<br />
    These gifts that I had once, and, having, scarce heeded?<br />

    To bring fair days about for which thou hast no blessing.<br />
    Then fall asleep fearless of dead days that return not;<br />
    Yet dream if thou may'st that thou yet hast a hope!<br />
    &mdash;For thy dull morrow cometh and is as to-day is.</p>

    <p>O sweet wind of the night, wherewith now ariseth<br />
    The red moon through the garden boughs frail, overladen,<br />
    O faint murmuring tongue of the dream-tide triumphant,<br />
    That wouldst tell me sad tales in the times long passed over,<br />
    If somewhat I sicken and turn to your freshness,<br />
<a name="page323" id="page323"></a>
    From no shame it is of earth's tangle and trouble,<br />
    And deeds done for nought, and change that forgetteth;<br />
    But for hope of the lips that I kissed on the sea-strand,<br />
    But for hope of the hands that clung trembling about
    me,&mdash;<br />
    And the breast that was heaving with words driven backward,<br />
    By longing I longed for, by pain of departing,<br />
    By my eyes that knew her pain, my pain that might speak
    not&mdash;<br />
    Yea, for hope of the morn when the sea is passed over,<br />
    And for hope of the next moon the elm-boughs shall tangle;<br />
    And fresh dawn, and fresh noon, and fresh night of desire<br />
    Still following and changing, with nothing forgotten;<br />
    For hope of new wonder each morn, when I, waking<br />
    Behold her awaking eyes turning to seek me;<br />
    For hope of fresh marvels each time the world changing<br />
    Shall show her feet moving in noontide to meet me;<br />
    For hope of fresh bliss, past all words, half forgotten,<br />
    When her voice shall break through the hushed blackness of
    night.<br />
    &mdash;O sweet wind of the summer-tide, broad moon
    a-whitening,<br />
    Bear me witness to Love, and the world he has fashioned!<br />
    It shall change, we shall change, as through rain and through
    sunshine<br />
    The green rod of the rose-bough to blossoming changeth:<br />
    Still lieth in wait with his sweet tale untold of<br />
    Each long year of Love, and the first scarce beginneth,<br />
    Wherein I have hearkened to the word God hath whispered,<br />
    Why the fair world was fashioned mid wonders uncounted.<br />
    Breathe soft, O sweet wind, for surely she speaketh:<br />
    <i>Weary I wax, and my life is a-waning;<br />
    Life lapseth fast, and I faint for thee, Pharamond,</i><br />
<a name="page324" id="page324"></a>
    <i>What are thou lacking if Love no more sufficeth?</i><br />
    &mdash;Weary not, sweet, as I weary to meet thee;<br />
    Look not on the long way but my eyes that were weeping<br />
    Faint not in love as thy Pharamond fainteth!&mdash;<br />
    &mdash;Yea, Love were enough if thy lips were not lacking.</p>

    <p>If love be real, if I whom ye behold<br />
    Be aught but glittering wings and gown of gold,<br />
    Be aught but singing of an ancient song<br />
    Made sweet by record of dead stingless wrong,<br />
    How shall we part at that sad garden's end<br />
    Through which the ghosts of mighty lovers wend?<br />
    How shall ye faint and fade with giftless hands<br />
    Who once held fast the life of all the lands?<br />
    &mdash;Beloved, if so much as this I say,<br />
    I know full well ye need it not to-day,<br />
    As with full hearts and glorious hope ablaze<br />
    Through the thick veil of what shall be ye gaze,<br />
    And lacking words to name the things ye see<br />
    Turn back with yearning speechless mouths to me.&mdash;<br />
    &mdash;Ah, not to-day&mdash;and yet the time has been<br />
    When by the bed my wings have waved unseen<br />
    Wherein my servant lay who deemed me dead;<br />
    My tears have dropped anigh the hapless head<br />
    Deep buried in the grass and crying out<br />
    For heaven to fall, and end despair or doubt:<br />
    Lo, for such days I speak and say, believe<br />
    That from these hands reward ye shall receive.<br />
    &mdash;Reward of what?&mdash;Life springing fresh
    again.&mdash;<br />
    Life of delight?&mdash;I say it not&mdash;Of pain?<br />
<a name="page328" id="page328"></a>
    It may be&mdash;Pain eternal?&mdash;Who may tell?<br />
    Yet pain of Heaven, beloved, and not of Hell.<br />
    &mdash;What sign, what sign, ye cry, that so it is?<br />
    The sign of Earth, its sorrow and its bliss,<br />
    Waxing and waning, steadfastness and change;<br />
    Too full of life that I should think it strange<br />
    Though death hang over it; too sure to die<br />
    But I must deem its resurrection nigh.<br />
    &mdash;In what wise, ah, in what wise shall it be?<br />
    How shall the bark that girds the winter tree<br />
    Babble about the sap that sleeps beneath,<br />
    And tell the fashion of its life and death?<br />
    How shall my tongue in speech man's longing wrought<br />
    Tell of the things whereof he knoweth nought?<br />
    Should I essay it might ye understand<br />
    How those I love shall share my promised land!<br />
    Then must I speak of little things as great,<br />
    Then must I tell of love and call it hate,<br />
    Then must I bid you seek what all men shun,<br />
    Reward defeat, praise deeds that were not done.</p>

    <p>Have faith, and crave and suffer, and all ye<br />
    The many mansions of my house shall see<br />
    In all content: cast shame and pride away,<br />
    Let honour gild the world's eventless day,<br />
    Shrink not from change, and shudder not at crime,<br />
    Leave lies to rattle in the sieve of Time!<br />
    Then, whatsoe'er your workday gear shall stain,<br />
    Of me a wedding-garment shall ye gain<br />
<a name="page329" id="page329"></a>
    No God shall dare cry out at, when at last<br />
    Your time of ignorance is overpast;<br />
    A wedding garment, and a glorious seat<br />
    Within my household, e'en as yet be meet.</p>

    <p>Fear not, I say again; believe it true<br />
    That not as men mete shall I measure you:<br />
    This calm strong soul, whose hidden tale found out<br />
    Has grown a spell to conquer fear and doubt,<br />
    Is he not mine? yea, surely&mdash;mine no less<br />
    This well mocked clamourer out of bitterness:<br />
    The strong one's strength, from me he had it not;<br />
    Let the world keep it that his love forgot;<br />
    The weak one's weakness was enough to save,<br />
    Let the world hide it in his honour's grave!<br />
    For whatso folly is, or wisdom was<br />
    Across my threshold naked all must pass.</p>

    <p>Fear not; no vessel to dishonour born<br />
    Is in my house; there all shall well adorn<br />
    The walls whose stones the lapse of Time has laid.<br />
    Behold again; this life great stories made;<br />
    All cast aside for love, and then and then<br />
    Love filched away; the world an adder-den,<br />
    And all folk foes: and one, the one desire&mdash;<br />
    &mdash;How shall we name it?&mdash;grown a poisoned fire,<br />
    God once, God still, but God of wrong and shame<br />
    A lying God, a curse without a name.<br />
    So turneth love to hate, the wise world saith.<br />
    &mdash;Folly&mdash;I say 'twixt love and hate lies death,<br />
<a name="page330" id="page330"></a>
    They shall not mingle: neither died this love,<br />
    But through a dreadful world all changed must move<br />
    With earthly death and wrong, and earthly woe<br />
    The only deeds its hand might find to do.<br />
    Surely ye deem that this one shall abide<br />
    Within the murmuring palace of my pride.</p>

    <p>But lo another, how shall he have praise?<br />
    Through flame and thorns I led him many days<br />
    And nought he shrank, but smiled and followed close,<br />
    Till in his path the shade of hate arose<br />
    'Twixt him and his desire: with heart that burned<br />
    For very love back through the thorns he turned,<br />
    His wounds, his tears, his prayers without avail<br />
    Forgotten now, nor e'en for him a tale;<br />
    Because for love's sake love he cast aside.<br />
    &mdash;Lo, saith the World, a heart well satisfied<br />
    With what I give, a barren love forgot&mdash;<br />
    &mdash;Draw near me, O my child, and heed them not!<br />
    The world thou lovest, e'en my world it is,<br />
    Thy faithful hands yet reach out for my bliss,<br />
    Thou seest me in the night and in the day<br />
    Thou canst not deem that I can go astray.</p>

    <p>No further, saith the world 'twixt Heaven and Hell<br />
    Than 'twixt these twain.&mdash;My faithful, heed it well!<br />
    For on the great day when the hosts are met<br />
    On Armageddon's plain by spears beset,<br />
    This is my banner with my sign thereon,<br />
    That is my sword wherewith my deeds are done.<br />
<a name="page331" id="page331"></a>
    But how shall tongue of man tell all the tale<br />
    Of faithful hearts who overcome or fail,<br />
    But at the last fail nowise to be mine.<br />
    In diverse ways they drink the fateful wine<br />
    Those twain drank mid the lulling of the storm<br />
    Upon the Irish Sea, when love grown warm<br />
    Kindled and blazed, and lit the days to come,<br />
    The hope and joy and death that led them home.<br />
    &mdash;In diverse ways; yet having drunk, be sure<br />
    The flame thus lighted ever shall endure,<br />
    So my feet trod the grapes whereby it glowed.</p>

    <p>Lo, Faithful, lo, the door of my abode<br />
    Wide open now, and many pressing in<br />
    That they the lordship of the World may win!<br />
    Hark to the murmuring round my bannered car,<br />
    And gird your weapons to you for the war!<br />
    For who shall say how soon the day shall be<br />
    Of that last fight that swalloweth up the sea?<br />
    Fear not, be ready! forth the banners go,<br />
    And will not turn again till every foe<br />
    Is overcome as though they had not been.<br />
    Then, with your memories ever fresh and green,<br />
    Come back within the House of Love to dwell;<br />
    For ye&mdash;the sorrow that no words might tell,<br />
    Your tears unheeded, and your prayers made nought<br />
    Thus and no otherwise through all have wrought,<br />
    That if, the while ye toiled and sorrowed most<br />
    The sound of your lamenting seemed all lost,<br />
<a name="page332" id="page332"></a>
    And from my land no answer came again,<br />
    It was because of that your care and pain<br />
    A house was building, and your bitter sighs<br />
    Came hither as toil-helping melodies,<br />
    And in the mortar of our gem-built wall<br />
    Your tears were mingled mid the rise and fall<br />
    Of golden trowels tinkling in the hands<br />
    Of builders gathered wide from all the lands.&mdash;<br />
    &mdash;Is the house finished? Nay, come help to build<br />
    Walls that the sun of sorrow once did gild<br />
    Through many a bitter morn and hopeless eve,<br />
    That so at last in bliss ye may believe;<br />
    Then rest with me, and turn no more to tears,<br />
    For then no more by days and months and years,<br />
    By hours of pain come back, and joy passed o'er<br />
    We measure time that was&mdash;and is no more.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
